# Deep Thought

Deep Thought is a collection of design notes and experiments around the rag2f kernel.
It is intentionally informal and focuses on:

- trade-offs and architecture rationale
- plugin boundaries and contracts
- future-facing ideas that may or may not land in core

If you are building plugins or debating architecture choices, these notes are a good starting point.
